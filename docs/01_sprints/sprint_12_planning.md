### US-S12-002: Stop/Regenerate During Streaming (2 points)

**As a user**, I want to stop AI responses mid-generation and regenerate responses so I have better control over the conversation.

**Problem Statement**:
- Long AI responses can't be interrupted
- No way to retry if response quality is poor
- Infrastructure exists but not fully implemented/tested

**Requirements** (FR-604, FR-605, FR-606):

- [ ] Stop button positioned clearly (toolbar or inline)
- [ ] Tapping stop cancels SSE immediately (<500ms)
- [ ] Partial message shows "Stopped by user" indicator
- [ ] Regenerate button (üîÑ) on AI message cards

**Testing**:
- [ ] TC-S12-006: Stop during streaming
- [ ] TC-S12-007: Partial message handling
- [ ] TC-S12-008: Regenerate last message
- [ ] TC-S12-009: Regenerate with different response

### US-S12-003: Conversation Date Association (2 points)

**As a user**, I want to associate conversations with specific dates so the AI has better context about what I'm discussing.

**Problem Statement**:
- Conversations created from Calendar have no date link
- Context service doesn't know which date to prioritize
- Users can't see which date a conversation relates to

**Requirements** (FR-607, FR-608, FR-609):
- Link conversation to selected date when created from Calendar
- Show date badge/label in conversation list
- Update context when conversation's associated date changes
- Allow unlinking date from conversation
- Filter/sort conversations by date

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Conversation has `associatedDate` field (already exists in model)
- [ ] Creating conversation from Calendar ‚Üí auto-links current date
- [ ] Creating from Chat tab ‚Üí no date association
- [ ] Conversation list shows date badge for dated conversations
- [ ] Date badge shows relative format ("Today", "Yesterday", "Oct 9")
- [ ] Tapping conversation loads context for that date
- [ ] Menu option to change/remove associated date
- [ ] DateContextService updates when date changes
- [ ] Context notes reflect the associated date

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Update Conversation creation to accept optional date
- [ ] Modify ChatTabView to pass selectedDate
- [ ] Add date badge UI in ConversationRowView
- [ ] Implement date picker for changing association
- [ ] Update ChatContextService to use conversation date
- [ ] Add "Remove date" action in menu
- [ ] Test context switching when date changes
- [ ] Handle edge cases (date in future, very old dates)

**UI/UX Notes**:
- Date badge: Subtle, secondary color
- Relative dates for recent (Today, Yesterday)
- Absolute dates for older (Oct 9, 2025)
- Clear visual distinction: dated vs undated conversations

**Testing**:
- [ ] TC-S12-011: Create conversation from Calendar
- [ ] TC-S12-012: Date badge displays correctly
- [ ] TC-S12-013: Context loads for associated date
- [ ] TC-S12-014: Change conversation date
- [ ] TC-S12-015: Remove date association

### US-S12-004: Enhanced Context Display (2 points)

**As a user**, I want to see what notes the AI is using as context so I understand why it gives certain responses.

**Problem Statement**:
- Context section shows "Context for [date]" but not details
- Users don't know which notes AI read

- "No context" state when no notes found

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Context section expands to show note list
- [ ] Each note card shows: date, excerpt, discovery method
- [ ] Excerpt truncated to ~100 characters with "..."
- [ ] Note cards tappable ‚Üí opens EntryDetailView
- [ ] Discovery method badge: "Today", "Same day", "Related"
- [ ] Empty state: "No notes for this date yet"
- [ ] Context updates when date/conversation changes
- [ ] Performance: Smooth expansion animation
- [ ] Accessible: VoiceOver support for note cards

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Enhance context notes in ChatContext model
- [ ] Add note metadata: excerpt, discovery reason
- [ ] Create NoteContextCard view component
- [ ] Implement navigation to EntryDetailView from card
- [ ] Add discovery method enum and labels
- [ ] Update ChatContextService to provide metadata
- [ ] Handle empty states gracefully
- [ ] Test with various note counts (0, 1, 5, 15+)
- [ ] Add smooth expand/collapse animation

**UI/UX Notes**:
- Card design: Clean, scannable
- Discovery badges: Color-coded
  - üìÖ Blue: "Today's note"
  - üîÑ Green: "Same day in past"
  - üîó Purple: "Related topic"

## Risks & Contingency Plans

### High Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Stop button doesn't cancel SSE reliably**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (bad UX)
- **Mitigation**: Test with various network conditions, add timeout
- **Contingency**: Fallback to "ignore remaining tokens" approach

**Risk 2: API key validation too strict/loose**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (user frustration)
- **Mitigation**: Test with real OpenRouter keys, check their docs
- **Contingency**: Allow override, show warning instead of blocking

**Risk 3: Context note cards cause performance issues**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (slow UI)
- **Mitigation**: Limit to 15 notes max, lazy loading
- **Contingency**: Add pagination, show "Load more" button
