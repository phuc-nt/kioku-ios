## User Stories

### US-S16-002: Flexible Model Configuration (3 points)

**As a** user
**I want** to configure which AI model is used for chat conversations
**So that** I can choose models that best fit my needs (cost, quality, speed)

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-13)

**Problem Statement**:
- Currently hardcoded to specific OpenAI models
- OpenRouter supports 200+ models but we're not leveraging this
- Different users have different needs (cost-conscious, quality-focused, speed-focused)
- Users cannot experiment with new models as they become available

**Solution Approach**:
1. Add model configuration in chat settings
2. Allow users to enter any OpenRouter-supported model identifier
3. Validate model availability through OpenRouter API
4. Persist user's model choice per conversation
5. Keep entity extraction and relationship discovery on fixed models for stability

**Scope Clarification**:
- ‚úÖ Model configuration for chat conversations ONLY
- ‚ùå Entity extraction remains on fixed model (gpt-4o-mini for stability)
- ‚ùå Relationship discovery remains on fixed model (gpt-4o-mini for stability)
- ‚úÖ Per-conversation model selection (different conversations can use different models)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Users can enter custom model identifier in chat settings
- [x] System validates model format (provider/model-name pattern)
- [x] Model choice persisted per conversation
- [x] Helpful error messages if model format invalid
- [x] Default model: gpt-4o-mini (current default)
- [x] Chat UI shows which model is being used (model badge)
- [x] Entity extraction and relationship discovery remain on gpt-4o-mini

**Technical Requirements**:

**FR-S17-001: Model Configuration UI**
- Add "AI Model" field in conversation settings
- Dropdown with popular models + custom text input option
- Popular models:
  - GPT-4o-mini (default, cost-effective)
  - GPT-4o (higher quality)
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (high quality alternative)
  - Claude 3 Haiku (fast & cheap)
  - Llama 3.1 70B (open source)
- Custom input accepts any OpenRouter model ID
- Show model description and pricing info if available

**FR-S17-002: Model Validation**
- Validate model ID format: `provider/model-name`
- Query OpenRouter `/models` endpoint for validation
- Cache valid model list (1 hour TTL)
- Show error toast if model invalid/unavailable
- Fallback to default if validation fails during chat

**FR-S17-003: Model Persistence**
- Add `modelIdentifier: String?` to `Conversation` model
- Default: nil (uses system default gpt-4o-mini)
- Store user's choice when explicitly selected
- Load model identifier when resuming conversation

**FR-S17-004: Chat Integration**
- Update `AIChatService.sendMessage()` to use conversation's model
- Pass model identifier in OpenRouter API request
- Display current model in chat header (small badge)
- Handle model-specific errors gracefully

**Technical Tasks**:
- [x] Update `Conversation` model with `modelIdentifier` field
- [x] Create `ModelConfigurationView` for model selection UI
- [x] Implement OpenRouter model validation service
- [x] Update `AIChatView` to use conversation-specific model
- [x] Add model display badge in chat UI
- [x] Integration test: Chat with different models (XcodeBuildMCP automated test)
- [x] Error handling: Model format validation with clear messages
- [x] Fix conversation persistence in AIChatView (added ensureConversationExists)
- [x] Fix SwiftData predicate error (use in-memory filtering)
- [x] Implement CPU button polling to enable model configuration access

**Files Created**:
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Views/Chat/ModelConfigurationView.swift` (236 lines)
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Services/ModelValidationService.swift` (169 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Models/Conversation.swift` - Added modelIdentifier field
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Views/Chat/AIChatView.swift` - Model parameter, badge UI, conversation persistence
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Views/Chat/ChatTabView.swift` - CPU button, lazy conversation creation, model config sheet
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Views/EntryDetailView.swift` - CPU button in note detail chat, conversation management
- ‚úÖ `KiokuPackage/Sources/KiokuFeature/Services/DataService.swift` - Fixed fetchConversation predicate error

**Implementation Summary**:
- ‚úÖ Model configuration UI with 5 popular presets
- ‚úÖ Custom model ID validation (format: provider/model-name)

## Success Metrics

- **Model Flexibility**: Users can successfully use 3+ different models
- **Export Completeness**: 100% of user data included in exports
- **Import Accuracy**: Imported data matches exported data (no loss)
- **User Trust**: Export feature increases confidence in app
- **Performance**: Export/Import < 10 seconds for 100 entries

## Technical Notes

### Model Configuration Decisions

**Why Per-Conversation Model Selection?**
- Users may want different models for different types of conversations
- Example: Quick daily check-in (fast, cheap model) vs deep reflection (high-quality model)
- Flexibility without overwhelming default settings

**Why Fixed Models for Entity Extraction?**
- Consistency: All entries processed with same model ensures consistent entity quality
- Cost: Batch processing requires cost-effective model
- Stability: Entity extraction prompts optimized for specific model behavior
- Future: Can make configurable later if needed

### Export/Import Design Decisions

**Why JSON + Markdown?**
- JSON: Machine-readable, complete metadata, import capability
- Markdown: Human-readable, nice formatting, no import (read-only)
- Both formats serve different user needs

**Why Include Encrypted Content?**
- User choice: Export with encryption (secure) or plain text (readable)
- Default: Encrypted (preserve security)
- Warning: Plain text export warns about security implications

**Import Conflict Resolution**:
- Default: Skip duplicates (safest)
- Advanced: User can choose merge or replace
- Duplicate detection: UUID match or content hash match

## Sprint Retrospective

**Status**: Sprint 17 Part 1 - COMPLETED (2025-10-13)
- ‚úÖ Part 1: Flexible Model Configuration (3 points) - COMPLETED
- ‚è≥ Part 2: Export & Backup (6 points) - DEFERRED to next sprint

**What Went Well**:
- ‚úÖ Model configuration feature fully implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Full end-to-end integration test with XcodeBuildMCP automation
- ‚úÖ All bugs discovered during testing were fixed (conversation persistence, SwiftData predicate)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (Service, View, Model)
- ‚úÖ Good documentation created (test scenarios, design docs)
- ‚úÖ UI/UX polished with model badge and CPU button

**What Could Be Improved**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No unit tests created (validation logic should have tests)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Debug logging left in code (should be removed or made conditional)

**Bugs Fixed During Testing**:
1. **Conversation persistence missing in AIChatView** - Added ensureConversationExists() and message persistence
2. **SwiftData predicate error with captured variables** - Switched to in-memory filtering
3. **CPU button disabled state** - Implemented polling mechanism to detect conversation creation
4. **CPU button always disabled for new dates** - Removed `.disabled(currentConversation == nil)`, added ensureConversationExists() on button tap
5. **CPU button missing from Note Detail chat** - Added CPU button to EntryDetailView sheet toolbar with conversation management

**Key Learnings**:
1. **SwiftUI @Bindable**: Works well for conversation model binding in configuration view
2. **SwiftData Predicates**: Cannot use captured variables in comparisons - use in-memory filtering instead
3. **Lazy Conversation Creation**: Create on demand (button tap) rather than first message - better UX
4. **Button State Management**: Always-enabled buttons with lazy resource creation work better than disabled states
5. **Consistent UX**: Ensure feature parity across all entry points (Calendar tab and Note Detail)
6. **XcodeBuildMCP Testing**: Full UI automation possible - caught bugs that manual testing might miss

**Technical Decisions**:
- ‚úÖ Store modelIdentifier as optional String in Conversation
- ‚úÖ Validate format only (no API availability check for MVP)
- ‚úÖ Display model badge when conversation has custom model
- ‚úÖ Use ModelValidationService.popularModels for presets
- ‚úÖ Lazy conversation creation on CPU button tap (better than polling)
- ‚úÖ In-memory filtering for date-based queries (SwiftData predicate limitation)
- ‚úÖ Consistent CPU button implementation across all chat entry points
