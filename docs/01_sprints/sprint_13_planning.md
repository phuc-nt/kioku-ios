## User Stories & Tasks

### US-S13-001: Entity Extraction from Notes (3 points)

**As a user**, I want my journal entries to be automatically analyzed for key entities so I can discover patterns and connections across my notes.

**Problem Statement**:
- Journal entries contain rich information (people, places, events) but are unstructured
- No way to automatically identify recurring themes or entities
- Cannot easily find all mentions of a person, place, or topic

  - **Events**: Occurrences, milestones, activities
  - **Emotions**: Mood states, feelings, emotional themes
  - **Topics**: Subjects, interests, categories
- Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for each extracted entity
- Deduplication: Merge similar entities ("Mom" = "Mother")
- Single note processing: Extract on save/edit
- Batch processing: Analyze all existing notes
- Store entities in SwiftData with relationships to source notes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] EntityExtractionService extracts 5 entity types from text

  "topics": [{"topic": "travel", "confidence": 0.9}]
}

Text: {journal_entry}
"""
```

**Data Model**:

  - **Causal**: Cause-effect relationships (A led to B)
  - **Emotional**: Emotion-entity associations (Person â†’ Happy)
  - **Topical**: Shared topic connections (Event + Place share topic)
- Cross-note discovery: Find relationships across all entries
- Evidence capture: Store text excerpts supporting each relationship
- Confidence scoring for relationships (0.0-1.0)
- Bidirectional relationships with types

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] RelationshipService discovers 4 relationship types
- [ ] Each relationship has: fromEntity, toEntity, type, confidence, evidence

- [ ] Build emotional analyzer (sentiment + entity linking)
- [ ] Build topical analyzer (topic clustering)
- [ ] Create batch processing pipeline
- [ ] Add relationship queries (find all connections for entity)
- [ ] Write tests for each relationship type

**UI/UX Notes**:
- "Build Graph" button shows progress dialog
- Relationship types color-coded in visualization
- Evidence popover on tap

**Relationship Detection Examples**:
```swift
// Temporal
"I met Sarah on Monday. On Tuesday, we went to Paris."
â†’ (Sarah, Paris, TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE, 0.85)

// Causal
"The promotion made me feel confident and happy."
â†’ (promotion, happy, CAUSAL, 0.9)

// Emotional
"Spending time with Mom always brings me joy."
â†’ (Mom, joy, EMOTIONAL, 0.95)

// Topical
"Discussed AI and machine learning at the conference."
â†’ (AI, machine_learning, TOPICAL, 0.9)
```

**Data Model**:
```swift
@Model
class Relationship {
    var fromEntity: Entity
    var toEntity: Entity
    var type: RelationshipType
    var confidence: Double // 0.0-1.0
    var evidence: String   // Text excerpt
    var sourceEntry: Entry // Where discovered
    var createdAt: Date
}
