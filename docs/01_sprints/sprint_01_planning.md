| iOS Keychain complexity blocking development | Low | High | Research existing libraries, create simple PoC first week |
| Calendar UI complexity exceeding estimates | Medium | Medium | Start với simple list view, enhance later if time permits |
| Auto-save battery drain concerns | Low | Medium | Implement intelligent triggers, monitor power usage |

### **Technical Blockers:**
- **Xcode/iOS updates:** Monitor iOS 17/Xcode 15 compatibility
- **Third-party dependencies:** Minimize external libraries in Sprint 1
- **Device testing:** Ensure physical device access for security testing

### **Scope Management:**

## Sprint 1 Retrospective (September 23, 2025)

### **🎯 Sprint Goal Achievement: MOSTLY ACHIEVED**
**Primary Goal:** Establish foundational journaling capabilities với secure local storage để enable rapid thought capture và data persistence.

**Result:** ✅ Foundation established với modern architecture, ⚠️ 2 minor bugs identified

### **What Went Well ✅**
- **Architecture Decision:** Switching to modern SwiftUI MV pattern + SwiftData was excellent choice
- **Development Velocity:** Completed core features faster than expected  
- **Technical Foundation:** Clean, maintainable codebase với proper separation of concerns
- **UI/UX:** Clean, intuitive interface với good user experience flow
- **Auto-save Implementation:** Timer-based auto-save working well với visual feedback
- **Modern Tech Stack:** iOS 17.0+ targeting enables latest SwiftUI features

### **What Didn't Work / Challenges ⚠️**
- **Sheet Dismissal:** Done/Cancel buttons không có proper action handlers
- **Data Persistence:** Entries auto-save nhưng count không update trên main screen
- **Testing Gap:** No unit tests implemented (moved to Sprint 2)
- **Security:** Encryption not implemented yet (requires more research)

### **Bugs Identified 🐛**
1. **Bug #1 - Sheet Actions Missing** (Priority: High)
   - Issue: Done/Cancel buttons don't dismiss EntryCreationView sheet
   - Workaround: Users must swipe down
   - Fix: Add proper button actions với sheet dismiss logic

2. **Bug #2 - Entry Persistence Issue** (Priority: Critical) 
   - Issue: Auto-saved entries don't appear in main screen count
   - Root Cause: Either SwiftData save issue hoặc EntryStatsView refresh problem
   - Impact: Core functionality appears broken to users

### **Action Items for Sprint 2 📋**
- [ ] **High Priority:** Fix sheet dismissal actions (30 mins)
- [ ] **Critical:** Debug và fix entry persistence issue (1-2 hours)  
- [ ] **Medium:** Implement basic entry list view cho browsing
- [ ] **Low:** Add unit testing framework setup
- [ ] **Research:** SwiftData encryption patterns for security

### **Velocity Analysis 📊**
- **Planned:** 10 story points (4 user stories)
- **Completed:** ~8 story points (core features working, 2 bugs reduce completeness)
- **Actual Velocity:** 8-9 points per 2-week sprint
- **Sprint 2 Capacity:** Plan for 8-10 points với bug fixes included

### **Technical Learnings 🎓**
- **SwiftData Migration:** iOS 17+ requirement worth it for modern data layer
- **@Observable Performance:** Much better than @Published for performance
- **Sheet Management:** Need explicit dismiss actions, can't rely on default behavior
- **Testing Strategy:** Should implement basic tests từ Sprint 1, not defer

### **Architecture Validation ✅**
- **MV Pattern:** Working well với SwiftUI, less boilerplate than MVVM
- **Service Layer:** Clean abstraction, ready for AI integration
- **SwiftData:** Type-safe, modern alternative to Core Data
- **Project Structure:** Package-based architecture scales well
