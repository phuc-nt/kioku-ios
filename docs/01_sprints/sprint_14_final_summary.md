## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **XcodeBuildMCP Testing**: Automated UI testing caught issues early
2. **Incremental Sessions**: Breaking work into 3 sessions maintained focus
3. **Documentation First**: Planning doc helped guide implementation
4. **Existing Patterns**: Reusing @Observable, SwiftData patterns saved time
5. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of optional Entry.date prevented crashes

### Challenges Overcome
1. **SwiftData Predicates**: Can't capture external variables - solved with fetch-then-filter
2. **Optional Date Field**: Entry.date is optional - proper unwrapping required
3. **Model Property Conflicts**: Insight.color naming conflict - renamed to displayColor
4. **Sheet Navigation**: Tab switching from sheet required specific UI patterns

### Improvements for Future Sprints
1. Consider navigation patterns earlier in planning
2. Add keyboard testing to XcodeBuildMCP workflow
3. Create reusable filter components for other features
4. Document SwiftData patterns and limitations

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Post-Sprint 14)
1. ✅ Update product backlog status
2. ✅ Merge sprint-14-ai-insights-search branch to main
3. ⏳ Create ADR for search architecture (optional)
4. ⏳ Sprint 15 planning (Multi-Model AI Support or Voice Integration)

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
1. Entry detail navigation from insights/search
2. Monthly insights timeframe
3. Insight bookmarking
4. Search history
5. Advanced search operators
6. Export insights feature
