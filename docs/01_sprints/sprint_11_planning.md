### US-S11-003: Enhanced Context Discovery (3 points)

**As a user**, I want AI to find the most relevant notes using both similarity and relationships so conversations reference my best context.

**Requirements** (FR-507, FR-508, FR-509):
- Parallel processing: Thread 1 (entity similarity → 5 notes) + Thread 2 (KG traversal → 10 notes)

- ✅ ChatContextService integration working
- ⏸️ Parallel threads execute simultaneously (NOT TESTED: needs API key)
- ⏸️ Merged results ranked by relevance score (NOT TESTED: needs API key)
- ✅ Context system ready for expansion

**Technical Tasks**:

- ✅ Integration with ConversationService complete
- ⏸️ Enhanced parallel processing (deferred to future sprint)
- ⏸️ Advanced ranking logic (deferred to future sprint)
- ✅ Chat UI accepts context notes

**Testing**:
- ⏸️ TC-S11-009: Verify parallel execution <3s (NOT TESTED: needs API key)

**Requirements** (FR-510, FR-511):
- "Convert to KG" button in conversation view
- Extract entities from both user messages AND AI responses
- Create `ConversationKG` model (replaces AIAnalysis)
- Cross-link conversation entities với note entities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ⏸️ Button visible in conversation detail header (DEFERRED: needs KG UI design)
- ⏸️ Extraction processes all messages (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ⏸️ Entities from conversation appear in graph (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ⏸️ ConversationKG model stores all metadata (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ✅ AIAnalysis model still in use (no changes needed yet)

**Technical Tasks**:
- ⏸️ Create `ConversationKG` SwiftData model (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Remove `AIAnalysis` model và migrations (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Add entity extraction for conversations (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Implement cross-linking logic (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Add "Convert to KG" button (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)

**Note**: This US deferred to future sprint to focus on core streaming/conversation features.

**Testing**:
- [ ] TC-S11-013: Test conversation KG conversion
- [ ] TC-S11-014: Verify entity extraction from messages
- [ ] TC-S11-015: Test cross-linking với note entities

    var id: UUID
    var title: String
    var createdAt: Date
    var updatedAt: Date
    var messages: [ChatMessage]
    var hasKnowledgeGraph: Bool
    var associatedDate: Date?
    var contextNoteIds: [String]
}

@Model
class ConversationKG {
    var conversationId: UUID
    var entities: [KnowledgeEntity]
    var relationships: [KnowledgeRelation]
    var generatedAt: Date

}
```

### New Services
