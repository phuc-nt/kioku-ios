## User Stories & Tasks

### US-S11-001: Streaming Chat with Gemini 2.0 Flash (5 points)

**As a user**, I want AI responses to appear in real-time so I can start reading while the AI is still generating.

- "Convert to KG" button in conversation view
- Extract entities from both user messages AND AI responses
- Create `ConversationKG` model (replaces AIAnalysis)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ⏸️ Button visible in conversation detail header (DEFERRED: needs KG UI design)
- ⏸️ Extraction processes all messages (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ⏸️ Entities from conversation appear in graph (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ⏸️ ConversationKG model stores all metadata (DEFERRED: future sprint)
- ✅ AIAnalysis model still in use (no changes needed yet)

**Technical Tasks**:
- ⏸️ Create `ConversationKG` SwiftData model (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Remove `AIAnalysis` model và migrations (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Add entity extraction for conversations (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Implement cross-linking logic (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)
- ⏸️ Add "Convert to KG" button (DEFERRED to Sprint 12+)

    var contextNoteIds: [String]
}

@Model
class ConversationKG {
    var conversationId: UUID
    var entities: [KnowledgeEntity]
