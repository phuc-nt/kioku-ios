// Added to EntryListView.swift
@Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss

.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
        Button("Done") {
            dismiss()
        }
    }
}
```

**Verification Results:**
- ‚úÖ Browse Entries modal opens and dismisses correctly
- ‚úÖ Entry Detail View accessible and dismisses properly  
- ‚úÖ Batch Processing View opens and dismisses correctly
- ‚úÖ All navigation flows working seamlessly
