**Subject: Strategic Proposal - Integrating "Kioku" into LINE: Accelerating the "AI Agentification" Strategy and Rebuilding User Trust**

### 1. Executive Summary

This proposal presents "Kioku", a new AI feature proposed for deep integration into the LINE application, designed to directly contribute to LY Corporation's two most critical strategic objectives: realizing the vision of **"AI Agentification of all services"** and addressing the foundational challenge of **user trust**.

"Kioku" is an AI-powered mental wellness journal that operates as a specialized **"Domain Agent"** focused on emotional intelligence within LINE. By building a **Personalized Knowledge Graph**, "Kioku" provides deep insights into stress triggers, support relationships, and emotional patterns of users.

> 📖 **Detailed Documentation**: For a deeper understanding of the "Kioku" product, please refer to [INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md) - Including detailed explanations of technology, user experience, and core values.

By deepening LINE's role as a life platform, "Kioku" will create unprecedented synergy across the entire LY ecosystem—from driving personalized transactions on **Yahoo! Shopping (Commerce)**, to providing proprietary data to enrich the **"LINE Score" (Fintech)** model.

### 2. Strategic Opportunity: Filling the Gap in the LINE Ecosystem

Millions of users, especially demographics concerned with mental health and self-improvement, have the habit of recording thoughts and emotions daily as a method of self-reflection. This is a highly engaged and loyal user group.

> 👥 **Target User Details**: See the [Target Users](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#target-users) section to understand more about the demographics and needs of this user group.

However, within our ecosystem of over 200 services, there is currently no specialized tool serving this deep need. The LINE application, as the user's communication hub, is the ideal place to integrate such a feature. This not only retains users but also deepens LINE's role from a communication tool to a companion that understands their lives.

### 3. Introducing "Kioku": A New AI Feature for LINE

When integrated into LINE, "Kioku" will address the core problems that journaling users face: **"information overload"** and **"lost connections"** with their own past experiences.

> 💡 **User Problem Details**: See the [Problem - Information Overload](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#problem---information-overload) section in the product documentation to better understand the pain points users are experiencing.

"Kioku" operates based on a unique technological approach:

1.  **Extract Meaning:** When users write journal entries in LINE, AI (via Cloud LLM API) automatically identifies and categorizes entities (people, places, emotions, topics).
2.  **Discover Connections:** AI then establishes contextual relationships between these entities (e.g., "Work" *CAUSES* "Stress"; "Sarah" *REDUCES* "Stress").
3.  **Provide Deep Insights:** A **Personalized Knowledge Graph** is formed, becoming the AI's "long-term memory". This allows users to chat with AI and receive deep, personalized answers with concrete evidence from their own journal.

### 4. Strategic Alignment with LY Corporation's Core Objectives

Integrating "Kioku" into LINE will be a strategic move, accelerating our most critical initiatives.

*   **A. Accelerating the "AI Agentification" Vision:**
    "Kioku" will operate as a **"Domain Agent"** specialized in "Mental Health and Emotional Intelligence" within our hierarchical AI architecture. It will provide higher-level "Personal Agents" with deep insights into user states, enabling the entire LY ecosystem to respond more intelligently and empathetically.

*   **B. Activating Ecosystem Synergy:**
    *   **Media (LINE):** "Kioku" will significantly increase engagement and usage time of the LINE application, consolidating its position as an indispensable life platform.
    *   **Commerce (Yahoo! Shopping, ZOZO):** By understanding users' emotional states, AI Agents can make nuanced commercial recommendations, directly supporting **the corporation's focus** on enhancing **"conversion capabilities"**.
    *   **Fintech (PayPay, LINE Score):** Emotional stability data is an extremely powerful credit risk predictor. Integration (with user consent) of insights from "Kioku" can make the **"LINE Score"** model significantly more accurate and comprehensive, creating a sustainable competitive advantage for **"LINE Pocket Money"**.

    > 💼 **More on Value**: Details about [Core Values](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#core-values) and [Competitive Advantages](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#competitive-advantages) in the product documentation.

*   **C. Perfect Compatibility with Technical Direction:**
    "Kioku's" architecture is fully compatible with the corporation's **"multi-vendor"** LLM strategy. Moreover, using Knowledge Graph to provide context to LLMs is a practical application of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, similar to the technology being used for the internal **"SeekAI"** tool.

### 5. Data Management and Privacy Commitment

We deeply recognize the importance of user trust, especially in the current context. Therefore, "Kioku" is proposed not as a standalone service, but as an inseparable part of the LINE application. This means all user journal data will be managed and protected according to the strictest security and privacy standards that LY Corporation applies to LINE application data. We will inherit all existing commitments, including the **"User Privacy First"** policy, to ensure users can use this new feature in an environment they already trust.

### 6. Potential Use Cases in the LY Ecosystem

| LY Service | "Before Kioku" Scenario | "After Kioku" Scenario (supported by AI Agent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LINE** | User feels stressed and passively scrolls social media. | LINE's AI Agent, recognizing stress patterns from "Kioku", proactively suggests: "It seems you're stressed about work. Last time, talking to Sarah helped. Would you like to call her?" |
| **Yahoo! Shopping** | User receives generic product recommendations. | AI Agent, knowing that "walking in the park" helps user reduce stress, suggests related products like new running shoes or a thermos for weekend walks. |
| **LINE Pocket Money** | A user with thin credit history is denied a small loan. | The "LINE Score" model enriched by "Kioku" data (with user consent), recognizes the user has high emotional stability and a strong support network. This allows the system to approve a small, personalized loan. |

### 7. Current Status and Next Steps

A prototype version (v0.1.0) of "Kioku" has been completed and is operational, demonstrating the feasibility of core technology (successfully extracted 119 entities and 105 relationships from real journal data using Cloud LLM API).

> 🎯 **See product vision details**: [Vision](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#vision) and [Current Status](./INTRODUCE_BUSINESS_EN.md#current-status) in the product documentation.

I believe "Kioku" has the potential to become a strategic project, accelerating our AI roadmap while addressing one of the most pressing business challenges.

I would be honored to have the opportunity to present a demo of this prototype directly to you and relevant product teams to discuss its potential in more depth.

### 8. Conclusion

Integrating "Kioku" into LINE is not just a new feature. It is a strategic opportunity to:
1.  **Realize** the "AI Agentification" vision with a deeply meaningful use case.
2.  **Unlock** new and highly valuable synergies across the entire Media, Commerce, and Fintech ecosystem.
3.  **Strengthen** user trust by integrating the service into the trusted LINE platform and adhering to the corporation's highest security standards.

By investing in "Kioku", we are not just launching a new product but investing in the future of a trustworthy, intelligent AI ecosystem that truly delivers a "WOW!" experience for our users.

Sincerely,
